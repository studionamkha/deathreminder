        Buddhists try to contemplate death every day and gain an awareness of death.<br /><br />
        The inexorable matter of impermanence and death within every life is very present in the Buddha’s teachings. Is
        this a cause for despondency? Not necessarily, the Buddha says. We can ignore or reject this truth and remain
        trapped in delusion, fear, and suffering. <br /><br />
        Or we can remember it, know it, and practice with it all the way to
        liberation. For instance, in one of the Buddha’s discourses, monks are urged to consider before they retire at
        night that they may not live until morning. Possible causes of death are cited (including indigestion and
        scorpions). <br /><br />
        If death were near, what would their state of mind be? What lingering mental or emotional concerns
        should they have addressed while there was still time? Could they face death with confidence, knowing they had
        given their all to awakening?
